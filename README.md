## Mission
Plausible Deniability is clone of Wikipedia, made using Rails.

It's full of fake data. It allows for creation of new data, viewing articles across categories, and featured articles. It also features 3 distinct user roles in visitor, member, and moderator. Users can create new articles in a stylized manor, including inserting photos.Moderators can view a revision history for each article and roll an article back to a previous version. 

User stories are visible on the (the project's Trello board)[https://trello.com/b/BNeFDkhs/client-project-1]. 

## Getting Started
Plausible Deniability is deployed to Heroku at (insert link here)[]. You can view it there or download a copy and run it as Rails project on local host.

If you need help getting started or navigating the app, take a look at (Wikipedia)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki]. We hemmed our design as closely to that as we could while maintaining plausibility deniability.
